# OpenShift Actions Connector

Coming soon...

### Project Structure

The backend is in Express, and the frontend is in React using create-react-app. Code can be shared across the stack from the `common/` directory.

The structure is adapted from [this blog post](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/08/17/cra-express-share-code), and the boilerplate code is in [this repository](https://github.com/gvanderclay/cra-express).
